ALX CAPSTONE PROJECT 

BUILDING WEEK 1
This week I was able to build All the essential parts of each page so that I know what I am working with moving forward. I have created the necessary buttons and layout for all three pages that will be in the application.

 What is to be expected inside the pages:

Home page - two clickable buttons at the top of the page “Create New Schedule” and “Create New List” following the buttons we are able to see the schedules as well as the lists.
Profile page - will have a picture in a circular form in the middle of the page and following the Profile picture we have the user information which is on the left side of the page
Login page - this page requires name and email and also has a button that leads directly to the Home page

Plans for building week 2
1. My application does not need an API therefore in this coming week I am planning on adding the rest of my components into the application and ensuring that everything behaves accordingly and looks close to the design I made in Figma.
2. Work on fixing my code so that I am able to see the output of my code.
3. Ensure that my buttons work and that I am able to add, remove and tick the schedules and lists
4. Working on an Icon with a profile picture that is clickable and leads straight to the Profile page
